Yep, you only need 3 ingredients and a little oil to pull off gluten free Yorkshire puddings. How awesome is that? And you’ll be pleased to know that these aren’t just piddly little Yorkshires… these puff up to be HUGE!

## Ingredients

- 200g cornflour
- 6 eggs
- 300ml dairy free milk
- 50ml cooking oil, to pour into each muffin hole

## Method

1. Heat your oven to 220C or 200C fan.

2. Add just under a tbsp of oil to each of the holes in the muffin tin.

3. Place your tin in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the oil is super hot, basically spitting!

4. Whilst your oil is heating, beat/whisk in your 6 eggs into your cornflour in a big mixing bowl.

5. Once thoroughly combined, gradually add your milk a little at a time. Mix together - I use a non-electric whisk for this but you could use a electric hand mixer if you like.

6. Pour your Yorkshire pudding batter into a jug so it's easier to pour into each hole.

7. Next you need to be quick! Remove your muffin tray from the oven and immediately fill each hole with your mixture until just under 3/4 full. They should sizzle a little. Be very quick here and get them back in the oven asap!

8. Place back in the oven and cook, still on 220C for around 15-20 minutes until golden and risen. (NEVER open the oven door during their bake, this will ruin them!)

9. Remove from your oven once cooked and serve up with a delicious roast dinner.

## Tips

Cornflour is so light – and that’s what allows your Yorkshires to rise and grow like you’ve never seen before. Of course, the better the rise, the more golden and crispy they can become.

But are they hard to make? Definitely not! But the biggest tip you’ll get is that the oil must be as hot as possible before you even think about pouring your batter into your muffin tray.

A little lower than ideal will still be fine, but for maximum rise, try your best to make sure the oil is sizzling hot. You really want to hear the batter sizzle even just a little as it goes into the oil.

Oh and don’t you dare open the oven whilst they’re baking, please.
