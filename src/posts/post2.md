Truffles make the perfect edible gift for family and friends – add a pinch of chilli to spice things up, or finely grate in some orange zest for fresh, citrussy zing!

## Ingredients

- 240 ml light coconut milk
- 300 g dairy-free dark chocolate
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste , or vanilla extract
- 1 handful of desiccated coconut
- 1 handful of mixed nuts , such as pecans, hazelnuts, macadamias
- 2 tablespoons quality cocoa powder

## Method

1. Pour the coconut milk into a small pan over a low heat and heat through.

2. Snap the chocolate into a bowl, add the coconut oil, then pour over the coconut milk and stir gently to combine – it’s important not to mix too quickly.

3. Stir in the vanilla, then cover the bowl with clingfilm and place in the fridge to set for at least 4 hours.

4. When the truffle mixture is almost set, toast the desiccated coconut in a dry frying pan over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly golden, then tip onto a plate.

5.  Return the pan to the heat, scatter in the nuts and toast for 2 minutes, or until golden. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then finely chop and place onto a second plate.

6.  Spread the cocoa powder over a third plate.

7. Using a teaspoon, scoop out little balls of the truffle mixture and roll in the palm of your hands, placing them onto a tray as you go. It’s totally up to you how you decorate them – roll the balls in the toasted coconut or chopped nuts, or for a simple finish, roll them in cocoa powder.

8. Return the decorated truffles to the fridge for around 10 minutes to firm up, then serve.
